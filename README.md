AZ WIC EBT Planning Proposal
============================

We're trying something new to improve the proposal writing/production process for the Arizona WIC EBT Planning Proposal.

Instead of writing in Word and trying to manage versioning manually, we're going to write in plain text files with something called [Markdown][md]. It's a simple way to specify headings and bullets.

We'll also be using a tool called [Git][git] to automatically keep track of the versions of files. Traditionally, Git is used as a source code management system -- a tool used by programmers to keep track of their code. Writers are starting to use it more because it has powerful versioning features.

Our goal is to make it easy to focus on the writing. We also hope to make the final production go smoothly.

Overview of the RFP

The [AZ WIC EBT RFP][az-wic-rfp] is available on the [ProcureAZ website][pro-az]. You'll need the username and password to access the site. It's available on the [CRM website][crm], or you can email Naomi or Greg for the username and password.
